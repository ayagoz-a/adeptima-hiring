# Adeptima Open Roles

Adeptima is currently developing the next generation of recruitment tool called - Headhunting CRM. 

Adeptima was started in 2004 in Tokyo. So our business, process and products are deeply connected with Japanese culture. We took unique features from Japan and mix it with the best practices from global IT community.

HeadHunting CRM (HH CRM) is a social sourcing and recruiter CRM application that helps to build a candidates profile. It collates data from social network websites like: Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter. Along with making an individuals profile, it also attempts to build a web of similary skilled connections (1st level & 2nd level) from an individual's list of friends. HeadHunting CRM can be used to track head hunting leads on multiple social network websites, to scrape data off social network sites for analysis and building links to other potential leads.

We are expecting commitment to deliver outstanding capacity and results that would exceed our client's expectations and are focusing on long-term vision and quality excelence. Adeptima is a profitable, successful and sustainble company. All our projects are self-funded, and we are not looking for outside investors help and quick,high growth solutions. Adeptima is a product-driven company with developers who are capable of taking full ownership of their projects.
