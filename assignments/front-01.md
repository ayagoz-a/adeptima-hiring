### Slider
- Use react-input-range for inspiration https://github.com/davidchin/react-input-range
- CodePen demo http://codepen.io/davidchin/full/GpNvqw/

### D3.js
- Study lightly ;) https://d3js.org/
- For line chart  use the latest version of D3.js. Currentyly 5.9.x and up https://github.com/d3/d3
- Get inspiration from https://github.com/wbkd/awesome-d3
- No charting libraries or wrapping libraries! Use only components from the official D3.js repo https://github.com/d3/d3

### Optional 
- Cover your component with Jest https://jestjs.io/ 
- Use Flow https://flow.org/
- Propose easy to use Documentation generator. Ex: https://esdoc.org/
- Create .drone.yml file for test coverage https://docs.drone.io/user-guide/pipeline/ 
- Create clean npm package https://docs.npmjs.com/ 

### Important !!!
- No typescript. We use Flow cause it's optional and easy to reuse/drop on other projects
- Use react-slingshot boiler plate for a quick start https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot  
- Study https://sass-lang.com/ Put all styles in /scss/ folder. We don't use inline CSS! 
- The end result should be a clean component with no dependencies except React.js itself and D3.js subpackages
- We are not expecting it to be a free job. Please request a fair remuneration for successful completion with the strict !!! end of the project date. If you can't deliver on time, we are not paying for your test assignment work.
